# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

Welcome to  the (one of many) Advent of Code Solutions repository!

This repository contains solutions to the challenges presented in the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.  
Each year, a new set of programming puzzles is released, and participants from around the world solve them using their programming skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and day and contributor. Each day's solutions are stored in a dedicated folder, and the code is written mainly in C#.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robinakerlund/AdventOfCode.git
